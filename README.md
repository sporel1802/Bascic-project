ðŸ’¡ Project Overview:
You're building a basic calculator that can perform simple arithmetic like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
HTML: for the structure (buttons, display screen)

CSS: for the design (colors, layout, spacing)

JavaScript: for the logic (what happens when buttons are clicked)

ðŸ“¦ How It Works (Concept):
1. HTML â€“ Structure
Think of it like creating the skeleton of the calculator:

A screen to show numbers and results

Buttons for numbers (0-9)

Buttons for operations (+, âˆ’, Ã—, Ã·)

Buttons for clear and equals (=)

2. CSS â€“ Design
Used to make it look like a real calculator:

The layout is arranged in a grid

Buttons are styled with colors and spacing

The display area looks like a screen

3. JavaScript â€“ Logic
This is the brain:

When you click a number or symbol, JavaScript adds it to the display.

When you click =, JavaScript calculates the result.

If you click C, it clears the display.

It uses basic logic to evaluate math expressions typed in.
